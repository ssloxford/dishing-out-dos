\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have explored the security challenges faced by the Starlink router in light of existing work on router security, and uncovered a denial of service vulnerability that abuses the physical properties of the attached dish.
This has highlighted the challenges inherent in establishing a secure connection between the browser and router for administrative purposes, whilst maintaining user convenience, which affect secure satellite router design more generally.

Some technical improvements are required, but a significant factor in this is steering users into making well-informed choices to maximize security.
These choices include changing administrative passwords, updating TLS certificates, and making use of guest networks to reduce the risk of drive-by attacks.
Through good UX design, it is therefore possible to have a polished user experience without sacrificing security.
