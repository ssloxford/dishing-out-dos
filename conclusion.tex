\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have explored the security challenges faced by the Starlink router in light of existing work on router security, and uncovered a denial of service vulnerability that abuses the physical properties of the attached dish.
The simplicity of the attack has highlighted a lack of due consideration to the threat posed by users inside the network, which could be mitigated through proactive security testing such as fuzzing.
Required technical improvements include the use of administrative passwords, local TLS certificaties, and restricted network interfaces.
We believe that, through these mitigations, it is possible to have a polished satellite internet user experience without sacrificing security.
