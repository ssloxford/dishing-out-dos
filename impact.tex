\section{Impact and Mitigations}\label{sec:impact}

Since this attack can cause outages on the order of minutes or hours from just a few requests, large networks containing many untrusted users are at the greatest risk.
Examples may include maritime and aviation traffic, internet caf√©s, or large organizations.
Large networks are more vulnerable to the ``drive-by'' attack by users running outdated browsers.
Since the Starlink routers do not password protect the network by default, malicious devices joining the network is also a serious concern.

Securing these physical systems will involve measures such as adopting password protection, using local TLS certificates, and the use of HTTP Strict Transport Security.
A dedicated administrative wireless network would prevent drive-by attacks, since no device will be connected to both the administrative interface and the public internet.
