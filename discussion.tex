\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

In Section~\ref{sec:attack}, we discussed how unauthenticated commands can be made to the Starlink user terminal to disable it.
These commands can, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:impact}, be issued by an attacker present on the local network, or instead by a remote attacker.
Therefore, these security issues are similar to those faced by other commercial routers and server software, where bootstrapping a secure connection in the first instance is non-trivial.

We therefore seek to outline the challenges and mitigations faced by the Starlink dish, and outline more general principles on secure router design.

\subsection{Challenges}

\subsubsection{Drive-by browser exploitation}

\textbf{TODO: write about CORS}
\textbf{TODO: mention somewhere that older browsers are vulnerable}

\subsubsection{Administrative credentials}

One of the key challenges to the security of the Starlink system is the unauthenticated nature of the commands.
Therefore, sending HTTP requests to the router is sufficient to perform the attack, without the attacker requiring any prior information such as a password.
However, implementing a password authentication system is non-trivial, and adds inconvenience to the user each time they need to use the interface.

One of the key challenges is that, since the Starlink modem does not use TLS to secure the connection, any password would be sent in plain text and therefore be sniffable to adversaries on the network.
However, password authentication by itself would prevent simple drive-by browser exploitation; a malicious website attempting to make a cross-origin request to the modem would not necessarily know the password, and therefore be unable to make the request.
This mechanism is used by multiple consumer routers~\textbf{TODO: cite} to prevent this attack.

\subsubsection{Trust On First Use}

An additional challenge with password authentication is securely establishing a password in the first instance.
Some commercial routers use default passwords, but don't design the UI to encourage users to change them.
As a result, password protected routers that remain on their default passwords can be vulnerable to drive-by browser exploitation.

One method for resolving this is UI design to force the user to change the default password on first use.
Along a similar vein, the Starlink default SSID is ``Stinky" to force the user to change it~\cite{stinky_starlink}.
Another similar method is implementing a Trust On First Use (TOFU) policy, in which there is no default password set, but the user is forced to change it.
This approach is used successfully in applications such as SSH.

\subsubsection{The use of TLS}

As aforementioned, even the use of password authentication is insufficient to prevent attackers on the local network from sniffing and reusing the password.
This same problem of packet sniffing is addressed on the public internet through TLS certificates.
An encrypted connection is opened between the browser and web server where a third party vouches for the authenticity of the server, preventing man-in-the-middle interception.

On the surface it appears that implementing TLS in this context should be easy; certificates can be created automatically, from widely-accepted root certificate authorities, even for private network services, using tools like Let's Encrypt.
However, there are a number of issues in implementing TLS in this context.

The simplest approach, which is used by certain ISPs such as FRITZ!Box, involves creating a unique certificate for each router~\cite{fritzbox_cert}.
Since TLS certificates can only be issued for domain names, and not for IP addresses, each certificate is assigned to the same address.
The router then responds itself to requests at that domain, using its certificate.

Issues therefore arise when initiating the connection.
If the certificate is signed by a root certificate authority, then any certificate from any router is equally valid.
Attackers can therefore circumvent the signed check by extracting the certificate from different hardware.
This issue is resolved if the certificate is self-signed, which allows users to download the certificate and load it into their browser to verify future connections.
However, it is then impossible to secure the transfer of the certificate, during which the attacker can insert their own certificate.

Even if implementing TLS with perfect security guarantees is not possible, the self-signed approach at least guarantees that an attacker has to intercept the connection where the certificate is downloaded, restricting when the attack can be performed.

In the case of Starlink, there is an additional problem re. downgrade from secure origin.

Drive-by pharming through browsers


Security constraints:

Defeating drive-by javascript:
unencrypted passwords prevents silent drive-by javascript, potentially
websites can still brute force or phish the password from you
some sort of CSRF token from my.starlink.com?

Defeating spoofing my.starlink.com:
Vulnerable: because it's using plaintext http
Reason: you can't make a request to an insecure origin from a secure origin (need citation)
use https
passwords prevent silently changing the dish

Attackers on local network:

HSTS could be used with TLS to secure this
CSRF tokens

%Additionally, certificates have not been issued to secure the traffic to the user terminal, meaning they are conducted in plain http.
%%\texttt{my.starlink.com} is therefore also served in plain http, since browsers do not permit resource sharing from a secure origin (https) to an insecure origin (http).
%%Although Starlink can prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that \texttt{my.starlink.com} is only served through their encrypted satellite data link, this still opens the door for other attacks such as DNS hijacking and IP spoofing.
