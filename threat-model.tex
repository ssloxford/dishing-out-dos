\section{Threat Model}\label{sec:threat-model}

The goal of the adversary is to modify the state of the satellite router, or its connected hardware, through exploiting the admin interface.
This is achieved by sending commands, well-formed or otherwise, to the router.

We assume that the attacker is capable of scanning for vulnerabilities ahead of time on their own equivalent hardware.
The attacker also has the capability to send requests over the local network.

There are two primary methods by which this can be achieved.
Attackers that can maintain presence on the local network can trivially send requests locally.
If this is not possible, the adversary may instead trick a legitimate user into making the request on their behalf, by means such as a browser drive-by attack.
