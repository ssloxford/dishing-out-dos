\section{Threat Model}\label{sec:threat-model}

The goal of the adversary is to disrupt service to users of the Starlink terminal.
This is achieved by rendering the terminal inoperative through sending malformed commands to the router.
Since the user terminal is unauthenticated, the only required capability is the ability to send requests over the local network.

There are two primary methods by which this can be achieved.
Attackers that can maintain presence on the local network can trivially send requests locally.
If this is not possible, the adversary may instead trick a legitimate user into making the request on their behalf -- for instance, through a shell script, executable, PDF script embedding, or malicious website.
