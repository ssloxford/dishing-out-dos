Satellite user terminals are a promising target for adversaries seeking to target satellite communication networks.
Despite this, many protections commonly found in terrestrial routers are not present in some user terminals.

As a case study we audit the attack surface presented by the Starlink router's admin interface, using fuzzing to uncover a denial of service attack on the Starlink user terminal.
We explore the attack's impact, particularly in the cases of drive-by attackers, and attackers that are able to maintain a continuous presence on the network.
Finally, we discuss wider implications, looking at lessons learned in terrestrial router security, and how to properly implement them in this new context.
