The Starlink user terminal is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack, in which the dish is put into an inoperative state until it can be manually rebooted by physically power-cycling the terminal.

In this paper we describe this attack in detail, including the fuzzing process used to discover it.
We also explore the impact of the attack, particularly in the cases of drive-by attackers, and attackers that are able to maintain a continuous presence on the network.
Finally, we discuss the wider implications, looking at common security challenges faced by commercial routers, and how they can be mitigated without sacrificing user experience.
